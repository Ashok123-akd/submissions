#DevRumble 2025 - Submissions

Welcome teams! This repository is where you will submit your final code for DevRumble 2025. Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure your submission is correct.

Folder Structure:
Each team must create a folder named after their team inside this repo.
Example:
submissions/
Team\_AlgoRangers/
index.html
style.css
app.js

Make sure all your project files are inside your team folder.

Important Rule: Push Only Once

* Do not push your code before it is fully completed.
* Only one push per team is allowed, containing all final project files.
* Make sure your team folder is correctly named: Team\_YourTeamName/
* Partial submissions or multiple pushes will not be accepted.

How to Submit Your Code:

### Step 1: Work Locally

* Create a folder on your computer with your team name.
* Add your project files and start coding.
* No GitHub required at this stage.

### Step 2: Install Git (if not already installed)

* Check by running: git --version
* If not installed, download and install: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Step 3: Initialize Git in Your Project Folder

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Final project submission"
```

### Step 4: Connect to GitHub Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/dev-rumble-2025/submissions.git
```

### Step 5: Create Your Team Branch

* Push to a branch named after your team:

```bash
git checkout -b Team_YourTeamName
```

### Step 6: Push Your Final Code

```bash
git push -u origin Team_YourTeamName
```

* Important: Only push once, after your project is fully completed.

### Notes for Beginners

* If you prefer a GUI instead of terminal commands, use GitHub Desktop ([https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)).
* Double-check your folder name and ensure all files are inside.
* Only the final project files should be pushed.

Good luck! Happy coding, and may the best team win! üèÜ
